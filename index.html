        Deep Space Medical AI Project
    </h1>

    <p style="font-size: 1.1rem; line-height: 1.6;">
        Deep-space missions face a major challenge: medical communication delays that can reach up to 
        <strong>40 minutes each way</strong>. During emergencies, astronauts cannot afford to wait for Earth 
        to respond. Our project aims to eliminate this delay by developing an advanced, autonomous medical AI 
        that provides <strong>real-time support</strong> even when communication is impossible.
    </p>

    <h2 style="margin-top: 30px;">Core Objectives</h2>

    <h3>1. Instant Medical Response</h3>
    <p style="font-size: 1.05rem; line-height: 1.6;">
        The AI reduces communication delay from 40 minutes to seconds by offering immediate, 
        mission-approved medical information and guidance.
    </p>

    <h3>2. Operates During Communication Blackouts</h3>
    <p style="font-size: 1.05rem; line-height: 1.6;">
        Spacecraft regularly experience signal loss. Our AI is designed to function completely offline, 
        continuing to give reliable support during total blackout periods.
    </p>

    <h3>3. High-Level Diagnosis Support</h3>
    <p style="font-size: 1.05rem; line-height: 1.6;">
        The AI helps crew members understand symptoms, consider possible causes, and follow 
        safe treatment protocols already approved for missions.  
    </p>

    <h3>4. Autonomous Deep-Space Operation</h3>
    <p style="font-size: 1.05rem; line-height: 1.6;">
        The system works independently for long-duration missions with no internet, no cloud processing, 
        and limited computing hardware. It becomes a self-contained medical support tool for crews 
        traveling far beyond Earth.
